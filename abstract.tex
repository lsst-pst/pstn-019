The NSF-DOE Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory will produce the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), producing 11 data releases over the ten-year survey.
The LSST Science Pipelines Software, the Optical Survey Pipeline Reduction and Analysis Environment (OSPRAE), will be used to create these data releases and to perform the nightly alert production.
This paper provides an overview of the LSST Science Pipelines Software, describing the components and how they are combined to form pipelines.
