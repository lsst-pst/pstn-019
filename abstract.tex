The Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory will produce the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and produce 11 data releases over the ten-year survey.
The LSST Science Pipelines Software will be used to create these data releases and to perform the nightly alert.
This paper provides an overview of the LSST Science Pipelines Software and describes the components and how they are combined to form pipelines.
