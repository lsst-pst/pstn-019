\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The LSST Science Pipelines Software has been developed over 20 years to support the processing of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
It has been used to process formal data releases from both Hyper Suprime-Cam and the Rubin Observatory's LSSTComCam and is now being used to process LSSTCam commissioning data.
The software is designed to be extensible and reusable, supporting a plugin architecture that allows new algorithms to be added without modifying the core codebase and includes a dataset tracking system and graph builder that supports scaling of processing on large batch systems.
The success of this architecture is further demonstrated by its adoption by several other astronomical surveys, including VISTA's VIR-CAM, WFST, GOTO, and SPHEREx, for processing their data.
The software will continue to be developed and evolve as new data releases are made and to support the community.
