\subsubsection{Trailed Sources}
\label{sec:trailed-sources}

The \texttt{meas\_extensions\_trailed\-Sources} package provides a plugin that measures the properties of trailed sources, such as those caused by moving objects like asteroids or satellites.
It measures the length, angle, flux, centroid, and end points of a trailed source using the \citet{2012PASP..124.1197V} model.
This plugin is designed to refine the measurements of trail length, angle, and end points and of flux and centroid from previous measurement algorithms.
