\subsubsection{Kron Photometry}
\label{sec:kron}

Kron photometry \citep{1980ApJS...43..305K} is handled by the \texttt{meas\_extensions\_photometryKron} package.
The aperture used for the fluxes is $2.5 \times R1$ where $R1$ is the luminosity weighted radius (also called ``first moment'').
The Kron radius is also available.
In this case of LSST pipeline output, the Kron flux is not corrected for light that is emitted outside of the Kron aperture.
While in many cases it will collect the majority of light, it will not be as accurate as the cModel (\S\ref{sec:cmodel}) for science cases requiring total flux.
