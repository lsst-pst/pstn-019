\subsubsection{HSM Shapes}
\label{sec:hsm}

The \texttt{meas\_extensions\_shapeHSM} package contains plugins that measure the shapes of objects.

This includes a suite of PSF-uncorrected shapes (for both objects and the PSF models) and a suite of PSF-corrected shapes intended for use in weak gravitational lensing.
These are all based on the adaptive Gaussian-weighted moments algorithm described by \citet{2002AJ....123..583B} (the \texttt{base\_SdssShape} algorithm described in \secref{sec:standard-plugins} is another implementation of this algorithm).
The implementation of these algorithms lives within the \texttt{hsm} module of the \textsc{GalSim} package \citep{2015A&C....10..121R}.

The PSF-uncorrected shapes include a variant that uses circular (rather than elliptical) Gaussian weights and another that adds noise to the PSF model image to match the noise in the data.
Both of these play important roles in measuring PSF model quality by comparing the shapes of stars to the shapes of the PSF model at the positions of those stars.

In addition to the plugins that measure (adaptive) weighted moments, there are also a series of plugins to estimate the PSF-corrected ellipticities of objects.
These are described more fully \citet{2003MNRAS.343..459H} in \citet{2005MNRAS.361.1287M}.
While no longer state-of-the-art in weak lensing, these algorithms are, fast, robust, and easy to use, as long as their biases are characterized via simulations \citep{2018PASJ...70S..25M, 2022PASJ...74..421L}.

In addition to the second moments that characterize the size and ellipticity of the PSF, higher-order moments \textemdash\ those beyond second order \textemdash\ capture more subtle aspects of the PSF shape, such as skewness, kurtosis, and other asymmetric or non-Gaussian features.
The definitions of the higher moments are given in \citet{2023MNRAS.520.2328Z}.
