\subsubsection{CModel Galaxy Fitting}
\label{sec:cmodel}

The \texttt{meas\_modelfit} package's CModel algorithm is a reimplemention of the SDSS galaxy-model fitting approach, in which we fit a PSF-convolved elliptical exponential profile and de Vaucouleurs profile to each object separately, and then fit a linear combination of the two with the ellipse parameters held fixed.
This is not as principled as a true bulge-disk decomposition, in which both models are fit simultaneously, but since each fit has fewer degrees of freedom, it can nevertheless work better on low signal-to-noise or poorly-resolved galaxies, where the degeneracies in a bulge-disk decomposition might otherwise lead to completely unphysical parameters.
In fact, in practice, CModel is better though of as a crude single-Sersic fit than a kind of decomposition.

Because these are PSF-convolved models, we expect CModel to provide decent photometry (including for colors) on both small and well-resolved objects.
At present, CModel flux uncertainties are known to be severely underestimated; at least some of this is due to the fact that the ellipse parameter uncertainties cannot easily be propagated into the flux uncertainties in the final fit.

The CModel code is essentially unchanged from the version used in the HSC pipelines; and additional details can be found in \citet{2018PASJ...70S...5B}.
