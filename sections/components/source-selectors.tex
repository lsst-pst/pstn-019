\label{sec:source-selectors}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{ObjectSizeStarSelectorTask} is used to find likely PSF-like sources to be used to fit a PSF model during initial calibration.
    \item \texttt{ScienceSourceSelectorTask} and \texttt{ReferenceSourceSelectorTask} select sources from a catalog given a set of configurable criteria.
\end{itemize}
