\subsection{\texttt{drp\_pipe}}
\label{sec:drp_pipe}

The \texttt{drp\_pipe} package defines the pipeline(s) to be used for the annual Data Release Production processing.
These pipelines include instrument signature removal \secrefp{sec:isr}, calibration \secrefp{sec:calibration}, measurement plugins \secrefp{sec:measurement}, coaddition and coadd-processing \secrefp{sec:coaddition-and-objects}, image differencing \secrefp{sec:dia}, source association \secrefp{sec:association}, and global calibration \secrefp{sec:calibration}.
Some of these tasks are shared with the pipelines in \texttt{ap\_pipe}, but are configured to prioritize accuracy over speed.

\texttt{drp\_pipe} currently has pipeline variants for LSSTCam, LSSTComCam, LATISS, the Rubin Observatory simulators, Hyper-SuprimeCam, and the Dark Energy Camera.
Because these variants serve as testbeds for DRP-specific algorithms and configuration settings, they are, as much as possible, the ``same'' pipeline, differing primarily entirely in loading instrument defaults from \texttt{obs} packages \secrefp{sec:obs_packages}.
The pipelines for some instruments also disable certain multi-visit calibration routines like FGCM \secrefp{sec:fgcmcal} and GBDES \secrefp{sec:gbdes}, as those can take significant effort to commission on a new instrument, and this has not been done in all cases.
The only other customization is an extra task for handling DECam's inter-chip crosstalk, which does not have an equivalent for Rubin instruments.
