The NSF-DOE Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory will execute the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) as its prime mission,  producing a series of data releases over the ten-year survey.
The LSST Science Pipelines Software, the Optical Survey Pipeline Reduction and Analysis Environment (OSPRAE), will be used to create these data releases and to perform the nightly prompt processing and alert production.
This paper provides an overview of the LSST Science Pipelines Software, describing the components and their integration into pipelines that generate science-ready data products.
