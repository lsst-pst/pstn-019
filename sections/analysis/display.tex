\subsection{Display Abstractions}
\label{sec:display}

The \texttt{afw.display} subpackage defines a simple image display abstraction layer that be used to show our image objects via multiple applications and libraries.
This includes programmatic control of stretch levels and colors, WCS mapping, semi-transparent bitmask overlays, and simple geometric region support.

There are currently implementations for matplotlib \citep{2007CSE.....9...90H}, Firefly \citep{2020ASPC..527..243R}, SAOImage DS9 \citep{2003ASPC..295..489J}, and Ginga \citep[][via Astrowidgets]{2013ASPC..475..319J}.
While most of these tools have considerable functionality beyond what our abstraction layer provides, the ability to interact easily with them in a consistent, programmatic way in many different contexts (e.g. DS9 on personal machines, matplotlib and Ginga in Jupyter notebooks, and Firefly in the Rubin Science Platform) is invaluable, and usually the \texttt{afw.display} provides all we need.
