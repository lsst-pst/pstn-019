\section{Key Algorithmic Components}
\label{sec:components}

Most of the key algorithms we have implemented for processing Rubin data are used in multiple pipelines, and in many cases an algorithmic component is used multiple times within a single pipeline.
For the most part, these reusable algorithms are implemented as regular \texttt{Task} objects, and these are combined in higher-level \texttt{PipelineTasks} discussed later in \ref{sec:tasks-and-pipelines}.
In other cases, the algorithm is inseparable from from its I/O, and is implemented directly as a \texttt{PipelineTask}.
This section includes examples of both.

% Each of these is a subsection.

\section{High-level Tasks and Pipelines}
\label{sec:tasks-and-pipelines}

In this section, we describe how the reusable components of \ref{sec:components} are assembled into pipelines for generating nightly alerts immediately from just-observed data, producing cumulative data releases roughly every year, and creating calibrations that are input to both on many cadences in between.
This also includes some description of algorithmic details that are specific to certain pipelines.
