\subsection{Validating the Science Pipelines}
\label{sec:validation}

We use small, of order of a few gigabyte, datasets that can be processed as part of continuous integration.
These take of order an hour to process.
There are regular re-processings of standard datasets that can take a few days to process.
For formal data releases there are additional metrics calculated and a test report is issued, such as the one made available with release 28.0 \citep{DMTR-451}.
