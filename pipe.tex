\subsection{Pipeline Support}

Tasks and PipelineTask overview.

The \texttt{Task} Python class provides a standard interface for how to execute an algorithm.
The \texttt{PipelineTask} variant provides stronger guarantees on configuration and provides a means by which the pipeline execution framework can determine how to link a task into a pipeline and how to determine what type of data should be read from a Butler and what should be written out to a Butler.

\subsection{Task library}

\texttt{pipe\_tasks}
\texttt{drp\_tasks}

\subsection{Pipeline Collections}

\texttt{drp\_pipe}
\texttt{ap\_pipe}
