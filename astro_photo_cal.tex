\subsection{jointcal}

\texttt{jointcal} fits both astrometry and photometry across multiple exposures of large mosaic cameras, fitting for both the true star positions/fluxes, and the distortions caused by the telescope and instrument.
\texttt{jointcal} is no longer used used by the LSST camera pipeline, but is available for use by cameras that are not supported by \texttt{gbdes} and/or \texttt{fgcmcal} (for example, DECam).
More details on the \texttt{jointcal} algorithm are available in \citep{DMTN-036}.
