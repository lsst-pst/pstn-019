\section{Core Infrastructure Libraries}

\subsection{Region Handling}

\texttt{geom} and \texttt{sphgeom}?

Use ICRS coordinates everywhere.
All coordinate transformations are done within Astropy.

\subsection{Time and Hierarchical Data Structures}

\texttt{daf\_base}.

Use Datetime only to store times in C++ objects.
Use \texttt{astropy.time} for all other time handling, following the recommendations from \citet{2016SPIE.9913E..0GJ}.

\texttt{PropertySet} and \texttt{PropertyList} to allow \texttt{dict}-like data structures to be passed from Python to C++ and back again.

\subsection{Application Framework}
\label{sec:afw}
\texttt{afw} -- this is called the ``Application Framework'' in \citet{2010SPIE.7740E..15A}\footnote{This document can be downloaded from \url{https://ls.st/Document-9349}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Image/MaskedImage/Exposure
\item Table and Catalogs.
\item Detection
\item Math
\item Camera geometry
\item FITS I/O
\item WCS: AST library \citep{2016A&C....15...33B} backs the world coordinate system handling.
\end{itemize}

\texttt{coadd\_utils} ?
