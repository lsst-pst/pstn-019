\section{Core Infrastructure Libraries}

\subsection{Region Handling}

\texttt{geom} and \texttt{sphgeom}?

Use ICRS coordinates everywhere.
All coordinate transformations are done within Astropy.

\subsection{Time and Hierarchical Data Structures}

\texttt{daf\_base}.

Use Datetime only to store times in C++ objects.
Use \texttt{astropy.time} for all other time handling, following the recommendations from \citet{2016SPIE.9913E..0GJ}.

\texttt{PropertySet} and \texttt{PropertyList} to allow \texttt{dict}-like data structures to be passed from Python to C++ and back again.

\subsection{Astronomy Framework}
\label{sec:afw}
\texttt{afw}

AST library \citep{2016A&C....15...33B} backs the world coordinate system handling.

\texttt{coadd\_utils} ?
