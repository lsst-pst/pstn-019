\subsection{Pipeline Support}

The \texttt{Task} Python class provides a standard interface for how to execute an algorithm.
The \texttt{PipelineTask} variant provides stronger guarantees on configuration and provides a means by which the pipeline execution framework can determine how to link a task into a pipeline and how to determine what type of data should be read from a Butler and what should be written out to a Butler.

Describe \texttt{pex\_config} because it's not described anywhere.

Pipeline in YAML.

Show plot of a simple pipeline visualization.

Graph building.

Show plot of a graph where a pipeline now includes specific datasets as inputs.

Describe that provenance is stored in the output files and in the graph itself.

Execution system and how BPS provides the interface between a quantum graph and a workflow system.
