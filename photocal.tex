\subsection{Photometric Calibration}

\subsection{fgcmcal}

Global photometric calibration is computed by use of the Forward Global Calibration Method~\citep[FGCM][]{2018AJ....155...41B}, as adopted for LSST Science Pipelines~\citep{SITCOMTN-086}.
This global calibration algorithm makes use of repeated observations of stars in all $ugrizy$ bands, combining a forward model of the atmospheric parameters with instrumental throughputs measured with auxiliary information.
In this way we simulateously constrain the atmospheric model as well as standardized top-of-atmosphere (TOA) star fluxes over a wide range of star colors, including full chromatic corrections from the instrument and atmosphere.

Running \texttt{fgcmcal} first requires generating a look-up table.
The input to the look-up table includes the effect of a MODTRAN~\citep{10.1117/12.366388} atmospheric model at the elevation of the observatory, as well as the throughput as a function of wavelength and position from the optics, filters, and detector quantum efficiency.
The quality of the output (in terms of repeatability of bright isolated stars across a wide range of colors) depends on the knowledge of the instrumental throughput.

The primary goal of fgcmcal is to provide a uniform relative photometric calibration of the survey.
For ``absolute'' (relative) calibration, a reference catalog can be used as an additional constraint on the fit.
Thus, the overall throughput output by \texttt{fgcmcal} depends on the reference catalog.
This can be checked with (e.g.) specific white dwarfs or CALSPEC~\citep{2007ASPC..364..315B} stars in the survey.
However, the relative spatial and chromatic calibration of the \texttt{fgcmcal} calibration means that the absolute calibration reduces to a set of 6 numbers (one for each band, or one overall throughput and 5 absolute colors).
